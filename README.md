# PCB Design Portfolio

Welcome to my PCB design repository! Here you'll find a collection of my academic and extracurricular PCB projects that I've worked on during my time at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## Repository Contents
This repository currently showcases two PCB projects:
1. BadgerBrigade - Academic project focused on designing a custom PCB for a remote controlled fire-truck, featuring motor control circuits and sensor integration
2. ChargingCart - FSAE project demonstrating a sophisticated battery charging system for high voltage Li batteries with voltage monitoring and safety features

## About These Projects
The PCB designs featured here represent my work from academic and university club activities. While I have additional PCB design experience from professional internships, those projects are not included here due to confidentiality agreements.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- PCB Layout and Design
- Altium Designer
- Circuit Design
- Hardware Debugging 
- PCB Assembly
